# Physics system

## Requirements

- Collisions Ball-Peg
- Force fields (attraction and repulsion)
- Collisions Peg-Peg

## Constraints

### Collisions Ball-Peg

- Distance computation

### Force fields

- Distance computation (long-distance)

### Collisions Peg-Peg

- Distance computation

## Solutions

- Proximity computation to reduce distance computation
- Avoid magnitude computation (avoid sqrt)
